# PEDRA_2D_LSTM
 2D SIMULATION adapted from original PEDRA repository (https://github.com/aqeelanwar/PEDRA).
This project does not connect to AIRSIM, instead does the simulation and training in 2D.
Currently, this project is a variant of the novel FCQN (fully convolutional Q-network) architecture
described in

 Exploration for Navigation in Unknown
 Environment"

This project adds recurrency to the FCQN by adding a recurrent Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer 
after advantage and state values. Adding recurrency to DQNs (deep Q-networks) has been shown to 
be beneficial, as described in

# Installing
It is advisable to create a new virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies.
```
cd PEDRA_2D_lstm
pip install â€“r requirements.txt
```

# Demonstration
Change the directories in infer_2D to your own and run with the latest weight given in the results/weights directory.

# Training
Change the directories in main_2D to your own and run. 

# Slides and Video
Explanatory slides and 2 demo videos are included.
